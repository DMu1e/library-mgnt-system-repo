layer 2. Data layer : contains the database with it tables
layer 3. service layer :  coordinates the interaction between the data layer and the observer integration, ensuring that operations like borrowing, returning, or reserving books follow the correct workflow.
layer 4. Presentation layer : this is the UI that receives all the input and output
